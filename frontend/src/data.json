The dishes are Middle Eastern/Eastern Mediterranean, including several options I\u2019ve not seen elsewhere in Potsdam. It\u2019s all very delicious and home-made fare. The place seems great for bringing friends to as there is something for everyone (including many vegetarian and vegan options). Also, it\u2019s very reasonably priced. Looking forward to visiting again very soon!",

It was busy whenever we arrived for dinner but we did not have to wait around long for our table. Splendid place to go for dinner, would undoubtedly highly recommend.",
