# Ten

Finding nice restaurants in a town can be a bit of a pain. We have a lot of data and review sites to access, but often are getting drowned in the data, and end up not much wiser then before. The idea behind this project is to, for each town, present the user with 10 carefully selected choices for a restaurant. These restaurants are displayed with big(ish) pictures and a review, so that there is immediately has a sense of what to expect from the restaurant. Sure, no user will find every 10 restaurants attractive, but the chance that there is one nice find is quite high. And one restaurant is more than enough to have a nice evening!
